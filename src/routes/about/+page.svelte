<TopNav>About Us</TopNav>
<main class="mx-3 my-8">
	<p>
		We are a group of passionate polytechnic students who believe that fashion shouldn't cost the
		Earth. That's why we created Fashion Forward — a community-driven app designed to make
		sustainable fashion fun, social, and accessible.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Through our clothing exchange feature, users can match and swap outfits with others, giving
		pre-loved clothes a new life. Our monthly styling challenges encourage creativity using
		sustainable pieces, while our Learn tab helps users explore topics like fast fashion, upcycling,
		and conscious consumption.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		We're also committed to giving back. We plan to donate 30% of our profits to environmental and
		social charities, allocate 10% to the monthly challenge prize pool, and reinvest 60% into
		improving the app and growing our community.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		At Fashion Forward, we're on a mission to reduce textile waste and empower a new generation to
		take a stand for the planet — one outfit at a time.
